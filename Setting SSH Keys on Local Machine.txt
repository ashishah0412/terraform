 Open a terminal and run this command:

eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<directory to private SSH key>

Note: Wen you do gitbash and open the session you will have to add the key to the ssh running agent every time 
new session is opened

To avoid this every time to be done when new bash session is opened do below:
1. Create "config" file in the "~/.ssh" on the machine
2. Add below line to the config file 
    host github.com
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<Private key>
